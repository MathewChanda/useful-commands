Useful commands and shortcuts
=============================

A collection of useful commands and keyboard shortcuts for Mac OSX and Linux. Mostly for my own reference but might also be useful for others :)


#### screenshots (Mac OSX)

`command-shift-3` : full screen

`command-shift-4` : selectable area

`command-shift-4` then `space` : single window


#### em dash (Mac OSX)

`option-shift-dash`


#### run app downloaded from internet (Mac OSX)

`control-click` then select `Open`


#### go to folder (in Finder, Mac OSX)

`command-shift-G`


#### connect to server

`ssh servername.uzh.ch` then enter password

`ssh -X servername.uzh.ch` if using GUI applications (then just launch apps as usual — requires XQuartz on Mac OSX)


#### find out where R libraries are saved

run R command `.libPaths()`


#### check Linux system/distribution info

`cat /etc/*-release`, `uname -a`

`nproc`, `lscpu`

`free`, `top`, `df -H`

`cat /proc/meminfo`, `cat /proc/cpuinfo`


#### check CPU cores (Mac OSX)

`sysctl hw.ncpu hw.physicalcpu hw.logicalcpu`


#### ls options

`ls -alh` : list files — including hidden files and directories (-a), long format details (-l), and human readable file sizes (-h)


#### show disk usage of directories

`du -ahc --max-depth=1`


#### check file type

`file <filename>` : for example to check which type of compressed file


#### number of lines in a text file

`wc -l <filename>` : stands for word count, number of lines


#### create symbolic link

`ln -s <target> <name>` : creates a symbolic/soft link called `name` pointing to the file `target`


#### set path

`export PATH=~/new_directory:$PATH` (paste in `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file; note order of terms matters — first has highest priority)


#### Terminal window (Mac OSX)

`option + click` to place cursor anywhere on a line


#### terminate a running process (Linux)

`ctrl + \`

Use this to terminate a process that is not responding to the standard `ctrl + c` command — this tends to happen with R sessions.


#### install program in home directory (Linux)

`wget http://address.of.file/filename.tar.gz` : download .tar.gz source archive (run in `/home/username/src` folder to save it there)

`tar xfvz filename.tar.gz` : uncompress .tar.gz source archive (run in `home/username/src`)

`cd filename` : go to uncompressed source directory

`./configure --prefix=$HOME` : run configure script (performs installation checks and creates Makefile)

* **IMPORTANT**: include the option `--prefix=$HOME` to install the program in your home directory instead of the default Linux binary directories

`make` : run Makefile (compiles the program and creates executables)

`make install` : run install part of Makefile (copies executables into directories)


#### superuser access on Mac OSX

switch user to admin account: `su Admin` (assuming account name is "Admin"), then enter password

then can enter commands as superuser with `sudo <command>`


#### GNU screen

GNU screen is useful when working on a server, since programs running in a screen session will continue to run even if the server connection is interrupted.

`screen` or `screen -S <name>` : create new screen session (with optional name)

`screen -x` or `screen -r <name>` : attach to running screen session (with optional name)

`exit` : close session

`screen -ls` : list running screen sessions

#### GNU parallel

GNU parallel lets you parallelize commands from the shell. This can be useful to greatly speed up runtime if you are running shell command-line utilities multiple times, and have a system with multiple processors.

Here is an example of how to run GNU parallel.

`parallel -j 24 fastq-dump --split-files -O FASTQ -- SRA/*.sra`

The option `-j 24` sets the maximum number of processors; the rest of the command after this runs once on each processor; and any arguments after the double dashes `--` are expanded out (here it is a list of SRA files, so each processor gets one SRA file).


#### git/GitHub — set up a repository

`git init` to create local repository in a folder

manually create `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE` files

`git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repository-name.git` (paste repository address from GitHub)

`git add .` to add new files


#### git/GitHub — commit changes

`git add .` (if no new files can skip this and go straight to commit)

or `git add -A .` to include file deletions

`git commit -am "commit message"` to commit (-a includes file deletions)

`git push -u origin master` to push to GitHub


#### git/GitHub — pull changes

`git pull origin` (merges into local repository)


#### git/GitHub — undo commit

`git reset --soft HEAD^` : Use this to undo the previous commit if it hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet, for example if you have added the wrong files or want to change the commit message.


#### render Rmarkdown document (R commands)

Enter these commands in an R session to create output in both HTML and standard markdown (.md) format. The standard markdown file is useful as it can be viewed directly in a GitHub repository (GitHub cannot automatically render Rmarkdown .Rmd files). With the option `variant="markdown_strict"`, line breaks entered as single backslash characters render correctly on GitHub.

`library("rmarkdown")`

`rmarkdown::render("filename.Rmd", output_format="html_document")`

`rmarkdown::render("filename.Rmd", output_format="md_document", output_options=list(variant="markdown_strict"))`


#### IPython Notebook

To run IPython Notebook: Open Terminal, go to working directory using `cd`, then type `ipython notebook`. IPython Notebook should then open in the default browser (Chrome or Firefox).
